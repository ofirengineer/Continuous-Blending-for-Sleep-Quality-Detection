# Continuous-Blending-for-Sleep-Quality-Detection
End-to-End Regression Model for Sleep Quality (1-10). Developed a full Data Science pipeline to predict a continuous health metric from complex biomedical time-series sensor data. Used Feature Engineering ($15+$ features), rigorous optimization (Wrapper/Exhaustive Search), and hyperparameter tuning.
